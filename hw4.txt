First, CGI is the standarded interface between the web application and the web server, which means that a procedure coule become a CGI communicating with the web server so long as it subjects to the criterion of the CGI. It makes it possible for the user at browser side to interract with some programs at the server side. By the way, the early CGI procedures are written in C or C++. 
As for php, as the CGI procedure, it could be the independently running process and responses to coming request by creating a new process or thread. 
However, when php becomes a CGI manager of apache, it will become a sub-process of apache, which means that it could be called by the apache.
In the second case, the php procedure will not need to comply with the CGI standard. In details, during a Http request, after being called by the Web server, before the PHP processor see a tag <?php, it just copies the input to the output, after <?php , the PHP processor begins to execute the script. The whole output which is a complete HTML page is transmitted to the Browser. The Browser will never see the PHP script. And a CGI procedure will get the input from the form submitted by the browser, run in the browser side and then bring the results to the browsers.
